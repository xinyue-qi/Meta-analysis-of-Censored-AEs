# Meta-analysis of cancer immunotherapy trials
### Case Study: Grade 3 or higher adverse event (AE; Pneumotinis Data)
The data to reproduce real-data analysis is available in a spreasheet named ``pneumonitisG35.csv``.
### Objective:
To evaluate the incidence probabilities of pneumonitis (referring to inflammation of lung tissue) in two PD-1 and three PD-L1 inhibitors in a meta-analysis of 100+ clinical studies.
### Method: 
The proposed Bayesian model (MAGEC) is developed to model a meta-analysis of safety data (e.g., AE) with censored information.
